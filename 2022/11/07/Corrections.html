<p>Which of the following is the most appropriate documentation to appear with the printNums procedure?</p>

<p>A
Prints all positive even integers that are less than or equal to max.</p>

<p>B
Prints all positive odd integers that are less than or equal to max.</p>

<p>C
Prints all positive even integers that are greater than max.</p>

<p>D
Prints all positive odd integers that are greater than max.</p>

<p>Corrections: I put A and the correct answer is B. The reason for this as put from collegeboard, “The procedure initializes count to 1. Inside the loop, the value of count is displayed, then count is incremented by 2 to the next odd integer. The loop terminates when count exceeds max, so all positive odd integers less than or equal to max are printed.”.  The function starts at 1 and adds two, and all the numbers are positive so therefore they are all odd and positive integers and the count has to be less then the max so the only plausible answer is B.</p>
