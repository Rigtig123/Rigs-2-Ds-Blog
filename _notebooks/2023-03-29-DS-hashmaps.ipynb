    "> A hashtable is a data structure that with a collection of key-value pairs, where each key maps to a value, and the keys must be unique and hashable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In Python there is a built in hashtable known as a _______________.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The primary purpose of a hashtable is to provide efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. When an element is to be inserted into the hashtable, a hash function is used to map the key to a specific index in the underlying array that is used to store the key-value pairs. The value is then stored at that index. When searching for a value, the hash function is used again to find the index where the value is stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The key advantage of a hashtable over other data structures like arrays and linked lists is its average-case time complexity for lookup, insertion, and deletion operations.\n",

    "## What is Hashing and Collision?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Hashing is the process of mapping a given key to a value in a hash table or hashmap, using a hash function. The hash function takes the key as input and produces a hash value or hash code, which is then used to determine the index in the underlying array where the value is stored. The purpose of hashing is to provide a quick and efficient way to access data, by eliminating the need to search through an entire data structure to find a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "> However, it is possible for two different keys to map to the same hash value, resulting in a collision. When a collision occurs, there are different ways to resolve it, depending on the collision resolution strategy used.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Python's dictionary implementation is optimized to handle collisions efficiently, and the performance of the dictionary is generally very good, even in the presence of collisions. However, if the number of collisions is very high, the performance of the dictionary can degrade, so it is important to choose a good hash function that minimizes collisions when designing a Python dictionary.\n",

    "What we can notice is that the output is a set containing the unique elements of the list [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]. The set data type in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements. When we create a set from a list using the set() function, it automatically removes any duplicates, which is why the output only contains the unique elements 1, 2, and 3. \n",

    "Why do you think Sets are in the same tech talk as Hashmaps/Hashtables?\n",
    "\n",
    "Sets are similar to hash tables/hashtables in coding because both are implemented as hash tables in many programming languages, including Python. In a hash table, data is stored in an array-like structure, and the location of each element is determined by its hash value, which is calculated based on its key.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of sets, each element in the set serves as its own key, and the value associated with each key is simply a placeholder value. This is similar to how hash tables work, where each element is stored at a location in the array based on its hash value, and the value associated with that location is the value of the element itself."
