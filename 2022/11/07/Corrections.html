<p>Which of the following is the most appropriate documentation to appear with the printNums procedure?</p>

<p>A
Prints all positive even integers that are less than or equal to max.</p>

<p>B
Prints all positive odd integers that are less than or equal to max.</p>

<p>C
Prints all positive even integers that are greater than max.</p>

<p>D
Prints all positive odd integers that are greater than max.</p>

<p>Corrections: I put A and the correct answer is B. The reason for this as put from collegeboard, “The procedure initializes count to 1. Inside the loop, the value of count is displayed, then count is incremented by 2 to the next odd integer. The loop terminates when count exceeds max, so all positive odd integers less than or equal to max are printed.”.  The function starts at 1 and adds two, and all the numbers are positive so therefore they are all odd and positive integers and the count has to be less then the max so the only plausible answer is B.</p>

<p>Corrections: I but D and it is wrong because “ The procedure does not interchange the values of j and k. Rather, it returns a new list with the values at indices j and k interchanged.”
 This means that this,:
 newList[j] ← numList[k]</p>

<p>newList[k] ← numList[j]</p>

<p>Does not mean they are interchanged but instead the values at indices j and k are interchanged. The right answer is B because college board says, “The procedure creates a copy of numList called newList. The element at newList[j] is assigned the element at numList[k], and the element at newList[k] is assigned the element at numList[j]. Therefore, the difference between numList and newList is that the elements at indices j and k are interchanged. The procedure only works if j and k are valid list indices, so it is important to document that j and k are both between 1 and LENGTH(numList), inclusive.”. I now understand what the function is.</p>

<p>What I got wrong: Collegeboard says, “The Internet was not designed to be completely secure. The protocols used on the Internet do not ensure that all communications are secure.” This means that open protocols and the internet in general was not created to be secure and instead have a different purpose.</p>

<p>Correction: Answer D is correct because collegeboard says, “Protocols are agreed-upon sets of rules that specify the behavior of a system. Protocols used on the Internet enable devices from different manufacturers to communicate in a standard way.” This means the use of open protocols are for their to be an open connection between devices via the internet.</p>

<p>What I did wrong: I put A and it is wrong because according to Collegeboard, “Statement II is true because colors can be encoded as sequences of bits. Statement III is true because sequences of bits can be used to represent sound.” This basicly just means that I thought binary did not have the capabilities that I thought because it can be used to ehelp encode colors as sequences of bits and for sound as well.</p>

<p>Correction: Answer is D because Binary can do all of these capablities. According to collegeboard, “ All digital data is represented at the lowest level as sequences of bits. Statement I is true because strings of characters can be represented by sequences of bits. Statement II is true because colors can be encoded as sequences of bits. Statement III is true because sequences of bits can be used to represent sound.” This means that binary can do much more then I thought.</p>

<p>What I did wrong: I put B and it is wrong according to collegeboard because, “Binary 1011 is equivalent to decimal 11 and should be placed before decimal 12.” This is wrong because decimal 12 is greater then binary 1101 since it is 11.</p>

<p>Corrections: The answer is A because sccording to collegeboard, “Binary 1011 is equivalent to 2^3+2^1+2^0, or decimal 11, and binary 1101 is equivalent to 2^3+2^2+2^0, or decimal 13. The order of the numbers (written in their equivalent decimal format) is 5, 11, 12, 13.” I learned more about the numerical values that are associated with binary now.</p>

<p>What I did wrong: I put D and it is wrong because according to collegeboard, “Instead of using a numeric variable to represent whether the student is absent, it would be more appropriate to use a Boolean variable because the status could be represented using only the values true and false.” This is wrong because a Boolean variable can be defined as it either happens or not which is true or false.</p>

<p>Corrections: The answer is C because according to collegeboard, “A student name is best represented using a string. The status of whether a student is absent can be represented using only the values true and false, so a Boolean variable is most appropriate. For both variables, using meaningful variable names helps with the readability of the code segment.” You use true false logic because it either means they are false or not false.</p>
