<p>Program Purpose and Function: To assist in learning more about NBA data, we will create a website that makes it seemless as well as include games within the website to guiz the users.</p>
<p>Data Abstraction: Collect data from varoius existing NBA databases</p>
<p>Managing Complexity: Use a list with various NBA data(PPG,APG,Accolade counts) and use a list to track it</p>
<p>Procedural Abstraction: will define our own funtions for formatting the page and displaying the data</p>
<p>Algorithm Implementation: will use iteration (lists for each funtion) and selection (if/else statements) and sequencing (step by step processes)</p>
<p>Testing: We will test every aspect of our project (and often) to ensure we identify and correct our mistakes.</p>
