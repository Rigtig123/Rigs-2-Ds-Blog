## Question 56
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/q1.png "https://github.com/fastai/fastpages")
The answer that I put was A, however the correct answer is actually D, which is Version II requires approximately 5 more minutes to execute than version I. This is the correct answer because Version I calls the GetPrediction procedure once for each element of idList, or four times total. Since each call requires 1 minute of execution time, version I requires approximately 4 minutes to execute. Version II calls the GetPrediction procedure twice for each element of idList, and then again in the final display statement. This results in the procedure being called nine times, requiring approximately 9 minutes of execution time. Therefore, this would be the most accurate comparison between the two. 

## Question 59

The answer that I put was B, however the correct answer is actually C, which is The original developer of open-source software provides free or low-cost support for users installing and running the software. This is the correct answer because Open-source software has source code that is released under a license that allows users the rights to use and distribute it. However, there is no guarantee that the original developer of open-source software will provide support for its users. Therefore, this is the why this answer is NOT an advantage of using-open source software.



## Question 62
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/q3.png "https://github.com/fastai/fastpages")
The answer that I put was A and C, however the correct answer is A and B. The reason it is B instead of A is because Since x OR y evaluates to true, the body of the IF statement is executed. Since x is true, true is displayed. However for option C, Since x OR y evaluates to true, the body of the IF statement is executed. Since x AND y evaluates to false, false is displayed.


## Question 63
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/q4.png "https://github.com/fastai/fastpages")
The answer that I put was B and D, however the correct answer is B and A. The reason that it is option A over D is because In order to perform the desired calculation, the selling price, the genre, and the quantity available are needed. The author is not needed. However for option D, the quantity available is needed to perform the desired calculation. The quantity available for each book is multiplied by its selling price to determine the total amount of money received for selling all copies of the book.


## Reflection
Overall, I really think I am progressing in getting better at taking these CollegeBoard Practice MCQ's. I am pretty proud of getting my score and think that the errors I made were pretty silly, and by looking back at the explanations, I was able to realize what I got wrong and why the answer is what it is. One thing I really see that I struggle on is finding both answers to a select more than one answer question. I will usually get one of them right but the other selected option more. I feel like while studying for these questions, I should try to answer more questions that have multiple answers so that I can get better at them.
