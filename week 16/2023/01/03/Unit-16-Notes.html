<p>Unit 3 Lesson 16
Notes</p>

<p>The main difference between simulations and experiments is that simulations replicate real-world scenarios digitally, while experiments are conducted in the real world. Simulations are typically less expensive than experiments because they don’t require expensive equipment. However, experiments provide actual results, while simulations use models based on collected data to provide estimates of what is expected to happen. Simulations can be used to estimate outcomes for events that cannot be safely recreated in the real world, but they may not always be the most cost-effective or time-efficient solution.</p>

<p>A simulation is a tool used to imitate real-world environments for safety or logistical testing. It is important to use random numbers and consider biases when conducting a simulation, and to evaluate whether a simulation is the best solution for the situation at hand.</p>

<p>when making a simulation you should consider:</p>

<p>Explanations for Answers
(3) Using a pseudo-random number generator in a simulation can make it less accurate, so it is better to avoid using one.</p>

<p>(4) In a flight simulation, the least likely factor to be removed for the sake of functionality is imperfections on aircraft.</p>

<p>(5) The main difference between an experiment and a simulation is the situation being considered.</p>

<p>(6) A car company can use simulation to determine the safety of their new car in the event of a crash, as it would be too dangerous to conduct such an experiment on real vehicles.</p>

<p>(7) An environmental group may use simulation to accurately predict the impact of the greenhouse effect on the environment, as it would be harmful to conduct an experiment on the actual environment.</p>

<p>(9) A teacher can use an experiment to find the average score on a final exam, as this will simply involve calculating the average and does not require simulation.</p>

<p>Reflection</p>

<p>Overall, I found these questions very rewarding because they were not incredibly hard where there was no point of doing them but they were not easy where I did not learn anything. It was a good balance between easy and hard. hese hacks were a bit challenging at first but with perserverance I was able to understand the concepts which allowed me to perform the hacks well. The presentation was great and I learned a lot from it. Out of all the presentations, I was able to retain a lot more from this one then others. Overall it was good and it helped me become a better coder.</p>
