Create Performance Task Planning

My task it to creat an API that updates day by day to show the stats of NBA players in order to predict their next stat line given their next game. 

Program Purpose and Function 
- The API and program I have will serve as both a database and a way to entertain people and provide them with a source to practice sports trivia.

Data Abstraction 
- I will store teams in lists based on their area and conference. Each team will have a conference assigned to them, which will hold their stats. I will then be able to have more in depth information. 

Managing Complexity	
- The list would be used to manage the teams and players. Without a list, the program would be inefficient, because it would have to call all players from a group before random selection.

Procedural Abstraction	
- I will develop a procedure to randomly select the two players and create an output for the user. I will store the userâ€™s response in a variable and use that to decide what to do on the next screen(game over or continue on).

Algorithm Implementation	
- The algorithm which I will use will check if the user chose the player with more of a certain statistic. If so, then another challenge will be generated. The challenges will appear until the user gets one wrong. This shows sequencing, selection, and iteration.

Testing	
- To test I will retry and repeat until it works. This will test the continuation feature of the game as well as the ending of the game.

Video Planning
This which I plan to show in my video:

- User correctly selecting player
- User incorrectly selecting player
- Final screen after wrong answer
- Game ending after player scores no points
- Game ending after player scores some points

I think the video will be able to be easily done under the given threshold of 60 seconds, since there are a few simple things to be shown.

Code Plan
Potential code segments to submit to Collegeboard:

- Usage of list to store list of players
- Code which will determine whether user will get another question or if the game will end
- Accessing the list storing the player data

With the code segments, it will be important to have segments which can serve for multiple requirements. Based on the examples, it looks like there are only a limited amount of code segments which can be uploaded, so it is important to use each one to its maximum potential.
