<p>Notes</p>

<p>undecidable problem: problems for which no algorithms can be built that can provide a correct yes or no answer.</p>

<p>problem: description of a task that may or may not be able to be solved through the use of an algorithm. An instance of a problem includes a specific input. One example of this type of problem is a sorting problem.</p>

<p>decision problem: problem with a binary answer (yes or no). An optimization problem is a problem with the objective of finding the BEST solution amongst many possibilities to solve a problem.</p>

<p>An algorithm’s efficiency is determine through formal or mathematical reasoning.</p>

<p>decidable problem: problems for which algorithms can be written to solve/produce a correct output for all possible inputs.</p>

<p>Hack 1
Decidable problems are those that can be solved through the use of an algorithm. An example is determining whether a number is even or odd. Undecidable problems cant be solved with an algorithmic procedure. An example is the halting problem which asks if the program will run forever or halt.</p>

<p>Hack 2
Which of the following is a 3 step algorithm?</p>

<p>A. 2 x 6 x 8</p>

<p>B. 4^5</p>

<p>C. (3 x 8)^2</p>

<p>D. None of the above</p>

<p>E. All of the above</p>

<p>Answer: C is the correct answer sicne you have to multiplky the numbers inside of the parantheses then take that value to the power of two</p>

<p>Hack 3 and 4</p>

<p>Using the data.sort function I was able to rewrite the code more efficiently ans easier to read</p>

<p>Hack 5</p>

<p>Explanation for Code: Imports the permutation method from the library itertools. Using this, we can use a built in command to create permutations. Using a for loop, we can iterate through all possible permutations, and print them. This is not only a much smaller piece of code, but it does not require recalling a variable multiple times, like in the former program. This is also more efficient for the developer, as it allows for the individual to code much less and in a simpler fashion.</p>

<p>Reflection</p>

<p>Overall, I found these questions very rewarding because they were not incredibly hard where there was no point of doing them but they were not easy where I did not learn anything. It was a good balance between easy and hard. hese hacks were a bit challenging at first but with perserverance I was able to understand the concepts which allowed me to perform the hacks well. The presentation was great and I learned a lot from it. Out of all the presentations, I was able to retain a lot more from this one then others. Overall it was good and it helped me become a better coder.</p>
