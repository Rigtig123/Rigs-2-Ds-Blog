<p>Night at the Museum</p>

<p><img src="/Rigs-2-Ds-Blog/images/oct.png" alt="" title="https://github.com/fastai/fastpages"></p>

<p>One of the first things I noticed when walking into the ceramics room was the Orange octopus because of how skillfully crafted it was. As someone who has done ceramics in the past, I recognize how hard it is to produce small pieces that connect together because it is super easy for them to break apart. Another thing I liked about the octopus is the coloring od it because the orange and dark orange makes the photo look very cool. Last thing I want to praise in this photo is tat the octopus tenticals are all the ame length and width which is very hard to maintain.</p>

<p>I also liked looking at Jefferys website. It was very well made because the frontend as well as the features he put in where very cool. When imputing things into the searchbar, actual results, although not fully working, displayed which shows the connection of an API which I can respect a lot because I personally tried to do that and was unsuccessful.</p>

<p>I like the photo of Ben Lee going up for a basket when looking in the photo room because it perfectly shows the sport in action. I like the contrasting colors between te black and red torrey pines team and the white and blue of the Del Norte jersey colors. Another thing I liked is how the only orange in the photo is the basketball so my eye was drawn to the ball which seems to be the focal point of the image. There is also leading like in the photo from the lines on the court to the lines of the flag pointing downward.</p>

<p>Other Photos I took while there:
