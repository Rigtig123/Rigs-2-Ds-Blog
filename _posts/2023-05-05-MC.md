I got this question wrong. It was a question asking about the outputs of two different values. I thought that since the display came first on program A, it would result in more values being printed before i > 10. But because program b adds first before it checks for the new i value, they will still have the same amount of values printed, just the values would be off by 1 so the correct answer is C.

This question was about moving a robot to the grey square. I thought that C was the correct answer as I thought the robot would move forward until it couldn’t, then rotate right and everything would work. But I forgot to take into account that towards the end it could move straight when it should turn right. TO combat this I should have chosen choice A where we first check if the robot can rotate right before we make it move forward.

I thought that since there were 4 genre lists that we would have to run the analysis four times, But if forgot to take into account the Analysis at the beginning of the segment where we ran it within science fiction, so the correct answer would be 5 hours which would match up with answer D.

Another mistake by me, I thought that we were trying to fix the code to make it produce true when the user typed “y” the correct answer is obviously D as the user cannot type both yes and y.

Reflection

Overall, I did this test with one of my friends and we tried to work together to figure out the questions and this helped a lot and even allowed me to learn new concepts because my friend taught me some things I was unaware of and I did the same with him. This coding gave me new things to learn and incorporate into my code and overall I think taking this test helped a lot. 
The usage of programs is very useful with databases. They help to be able to efficiently go through and get the data required. I learned the definition of heuristic solutions, how to deal with repeats and loops, and many other coding things that I can use when I try to code myself. The test took a long time also but there are a lot of different coding topics and languages that helped me and though the help of others, and looking up some of the answers to understand how to do certain things, I was able to take a lot from this experience and learn.
