    "I got Question #10 on the quiz because I wasnâ€™t exactly sure how many for loops we needed to use, but I knew that we needed to use a for loop because. There was 3 lists in the list, so I thought we could just use one for loop in order to iterate through. I believe that using one for loop would work but be less efficient, I think that by using 2 for loops it iterates through the lists much faster."

I did not eknow much at the start but I turned to learn how to do some of it making it easier and easier the more I did it. I felt like I knew everything from the quiz and could answer every question. I just had a little bit of a problem with Question 10. I was not sure how many loops are exactly needed to iterate through the lists efficiently. Overall, I felt that the quiz was pretty easy and everything that was in the quiz was covered during the lesson"
