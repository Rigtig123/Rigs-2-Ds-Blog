Answer B is correct, filtering by photographer will remove any entries with unknown photographers. Filtering by year will remove any entries with unknown years. Sorting by year will sort the remaining entries in column C from least to greatest, putting the photograph with the lowest year value in the first row of the spreadsheet. D is correct which I did not put, sorting by year will sort the spreadsheet on column C from least to greatest. Filtering by year will remove any entries with unknown years. Filtering by photographer will remove any entries with unknown photographers. Since the order of the entries is not affected by the filters, the photograph with the lowest year value will be in the first row of the spreadsheet. I put C which is wrong, this sequence of steps does not remove any entries with an unknown year, so the entry in the first row of the spreadsheet will have a year value of -1.

Reflection

Overall, I did this test with one of my friends and we tried to work together to figure out the questions and this helped a lot and even allowed me to learn new concepts because my friend taught me some things I was unaware of and I did the same with him. This coding gave me new things to learn and incorporate into my code and overall I think taking this test helped a lot. 
The usage of programs is very useful with databases. They help to be able to efficiently go through and get the data required. I learned the definition of heuristic solutions, how to deal with repeats and loops, and many other coding things that I can use when I try to code myself. The test took a long time also but there are a lot of different coding topics and languages that helped me and though the help of others, and looking up some of the answers to understand how to do certain things, I was able to take a lot from this experience and learn.
