# Notes

-elements:a single value in a list that has a special index. An index also makes references to elements.

-index:using natural integers when referring entries in a list 

-All types of elements can be stored in lists.

-All list operations result in an error notice and program termination if a list index is less than 1 or more than the list length.

-Data abstraction creates a barrier between a data type's abstract properties and the specifics of its representation.

-A program's abstraction that may store a value is known as a variable. Each variable has a corresponding data storage that holds a single value at a time, but that value may be a list or other collection, which in turn may hold numerous values.

-The readability of program code and comprehension of the values that the variables represent are improved by using sensible variable names.

-Some computer languages offer data types, which are referred to by variables, to represent data. Numbers, Booleans, lists, and strings are some of these types.

-One form of datum is more appropriate for representing some values than another.

-a variable is an abstraction inside a program that can hold a value

-assign stored values to a variable


# Vocab


Applications programming interface (API): which is a list of constructors and instance methods or operations, used to specify the behavior of an abstract data type

list: a sequence of several variables grouped together

variable: a way of storing information in a computer program, which could later be changed, referenced, and used

data types: a set of values and operations on those values

abstract data types: a data type whose internal representation is hidden from the client

client: a program that uses a data type

objects: a structure that can take on a data-type value
