<p>Create Performance Task Planning</p>

<p>My task it to creat an API that updates day by day to show the stats of NBA players in order to predict their next stat line given their next game.</p>

<p>Program Purpose and Function</p>
<ul>
  <li>The API and program I have will serve as both a database and a way to entertain people and provide them with a source to practice sports trivia.</li>
</ul>

<p>Data Abstraction</p>
<ul>
  <li>I will store teams in lists based on their area and conference. Each team will have a conference assigned to them, which will hold their stats. I will then be able to have more in depth information.</li>
</ul>

<p>Managing Complexity</p>
<ul>
  <li>The list would be used to manage the teams and players. Without a list, the program would be inefficient, because it would have to call all players from a group before random selection.</li>
</ul>

<p>Procedural Abstraction</p>
<ul>
  <li>I will develop a procedure to randomly select the two players and create an output for the user. I will store the userâ€™s response in a variable and use that to decide what to do on the next screen(game over or continue on).</li>
</ul>

<p>Algorithm Implementation</p>
<ul>
  <li>The algorithm which I will use will check if the user chose the player with more of a certain statistic. If so, then another challenge will be generated. The challenges will appear until the user gets one wrong. This shows sequencing, selection, and iteration.</li>
</ul>

<p>Testing</p>
<ul>
  <li>To test I will retry and repeat until it works. This will test the continuation feature of the game as well as the ending of the game.</li>
</ul>

<p>Video Planning
This which I plan to show in my video:</p>

<ul>
  <li>User correctly selecting player</li>
  <li>User incorrectly selecting player</li>
  <li>Final screen after wrong answer</li>
  <li>Game ending after player scores no points</li>
  <li>Game ending after player scores some points</li>
</ul>

<p>I think the video will be able to be easily done under the given threshold of 60 seconds, since there are a few simple things to be shown.</p>

<p>Code Plan
Potential code segments to submit to Collegeboard:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Usage of list to store list of players</li>
  <li>Code which will determine whether user will get another question or if the game will end</li>
  <li>Accessing the list storing the player data</li>
</ul>

<p>With the code segments, it will be important to have segments which can serve for multiple requirements. Based on the examples, it looks like there are only a limited amount of code segments which can be uploaded, so it is important to use each one to its maximum potential.</p>
