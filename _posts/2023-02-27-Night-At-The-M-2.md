Night at the Museum

One of the first things I noticed when walking into the ceramics room was the Orange octopus because of how skillfully crafted it was. As someone who has done ceramics in the past, I recognize how hard it is to produce small pieces that connect together because it is super easy for them to break apart. Another thing I liked about the octopus is the coloring od it because the orange and dark orange makes the photo look very cool. Last thing I want to praise in this photo is tat the octopus tenticals are all the ame length and width which is very hard to maintain.

I also liked looking at Jefferys website. It was very well made because the frontend as well as the features he put in where very cool. When imputing things into the searchbar, actual results, although not fully working, displayed which shows the connection of an API which I can respect a lot because I personally tried to do that and was unsuccessful.

I like the photo of Ben Lee going up for a basket when looking in the photo room because it perfectly shows the sport in action. I like the contrasting colors between te black and red torrey pines team and the white and blue of the Del Norte jersey colors. Another thing I liked is how the only orange in the photo is the basketball so my eye was drawn to the ball which seems to be the focal point of the image. There is also leading like in the photo from the lines on the court to the lines of the flag pointing downward.

reflection
In all honesty Night at the Museum did not go that well for us because we came unprepared and willing to take a massive L. This was 100 percent our fault, all we had was a quiz made in the front end and nothing else. We showed a few people and all they could do was laugh. we should it to Mr.Yeung and he was dissapointed but I understood why. As a result we worked very hard to have a finished product by the end of break. Natm was a wake up call. Besides my experience personally the event was very cool because the ceramic was very ornate and well put together. The photos looked legit and taken by actual pros. One photo not depicted here was a photo of a flower which seems boring but the detail was breath taking and insane. The code i saw was lowkey dissapointing because most people did not have everything complete also. It gave us hope to keep working.
