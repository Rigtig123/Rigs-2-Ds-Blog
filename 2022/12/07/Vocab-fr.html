<p>Section 8 Necessary Vocabulary</p>

<p>Iteration - Repitition of a Process
For Loop - FOR LOOP repeats a function for a set number of times; I is the number of times repeated</p>

<p>While Loop - The while loop is used to repeat a section of code an unknown number of times until a specific condition is met</p>

<p>Initialization - What sets the counter variable to a starting value. For example (var i = 0) represents an initial value of 0.</p>

<p>Condition - Allows the computer to know whether or not to keep repeating the loop.
increment/decrement - Modifies the counter variable after each repetition.</p>

<p>Section 10 Necessary Vocabulary</p>
<ul>
  <li>Indexing / List Index - The position of an element in a list, starting from 0 append, remove, pop - Various methods, append adds an element to the end, remove removes at an index, and pop removes the last item.</li>
  <li>Elements [in a list] - An item in a list.</li>
  <li>Nesting - Having one data type or function inside another data type or function, such as lists or loops. array - Another name for a list, depends on the language</li>
</ul>

<p>What is Iteration?
An Iterative statements are also called loops, and they repeat themselves over and over until the condition for stopping is met.</p>

<p>In College Board’s Pseudocode, the first is a REPEAT n TIMES loop, where the n represents some number.</p>

<p>The second type of loop is a REPEAT UNTIL (condition) loop, where the loop will continue to run until a condition is met.</p>

<p>A while loop is very similar to an if conditional, except that a while is continually executed until it’s no longer true and an if is only executed once.</p>
